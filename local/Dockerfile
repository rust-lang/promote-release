# Container image to run the release process on. This is meant to be used
# locally, and should not be relied upon for production.

# Downloading the `mc` client from dl.min.io is unbearably slow from Europe (it
# regularly takes 2 minutes to download 20MB of binary). The only other way
# they distribute the CLI is from Docker, so we load their image as a stage and
# then copy the binary from it later in the build.
