//! This takes care of mapping our input set of tarballs to the output set of tarballs.
//!
//! Currently rust-lang/rust CI produces .xz tarballs with moderate compression, and this module
//! maps that into the following:
//!
//! * gzip tarballs, with compression=9
//! * xz tarballs, with manually tuned compression settings
//!
//! We have ~500 tarballs as of March 2023, and this recompression takes a considerable amount of
//! time, particularly for the xz outputs. In our infrastructure this runs on a 72 vCPU container to
//! finish in a reasonable amount of time.
